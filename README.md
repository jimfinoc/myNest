# myNest - a python interface for the Nest Thermostat by jimfinoc. 
# 
# MyNest is an implementation of PyNest written by Scott M. Baker, smbaker@gmail.com, http://www.smbaker.com/. I thank him for the hours he spent developing his code.
# His software is much more capable but you must enter a password and user name as a paramater when executing the code from the command line. My interpretation allows the password and username to be stored in a json file in the parent directory. 
# Make sure your higher level directory has the JSON file called passwordFile.json.
